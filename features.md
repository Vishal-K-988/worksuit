# things I'm getting in mind 
1. lazy loading 
2. on-boarding screen : Client / Freelancer ! 
    - and guide the user accordingly! 
    - for now clients can do everything what a freelancer can but :

3. Dashboard : 
    - Integrate AI 
    - Navigation 
    - Onboarding screen 
    - sidebar 
    - Portals 
    - Gmeet 
    - 

4. DiceUI 

5. AI :
